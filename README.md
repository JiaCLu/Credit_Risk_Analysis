# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The credit risk analysis apply machine learning to solve outnumber risky loans. I use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub and apply the dataset using imbalanced-learn and scimitar-learn libraries to build models using resampling. I then compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.

## Results:

### Oversampling: **Compare Naive Random Oversampling** and **SMOTE algorithm** to determine which algorithm results in the best performance.
